## DratSky

A Sky Go launcher and controller for Windows. The program allows the user to control Sky Go via the keyboard or a remote control, making it easier to use via a 10-foot interface. The program can be launched from Kodi using Advanced Launcher.

###Update 28/03/2016 - Version 1.0.5

####New features:

    1. Automatic screen calibration.
    2. Improved installation program.
    3. Monitor selection.
    4. Improved website support.

####Details:

The screen calibration process was designed to overcome the issue of locating onscreen controls on screens of different resolutions. The new method of determining the position of onscreen controls automatically should work for most, if not all, users.

The improved website support forces the Sky Go website to recognise DratSky's built in browser as the latest version of Internet Explorer in order to overcome some compatibility issues.

The new installation program allows the user to customise the setup process by selecting the start menu location, and adding the option to create a desktop shortcut.

###Planned Features

    1. Support for On Demand (Box Sets and Catch Up TV).
    2. Search.
    3. Mobile remote control functionality on smartphones.

I've been researching how to make a remote control interface for smartphones. This will enable users without IR remotes or joypads to benefit from the use of a 10-foot user interface (controlling DratSky from the comfort of your sofa).
